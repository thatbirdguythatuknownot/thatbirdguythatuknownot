Hello. I'm... let's just say my nickname, Crowthebird. I work on projects when I am bored.

I contributed 3 updates to CPython that I consider major:<br/>
[Supporting building CPython with VS 2022](https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/29577)<br/>
[Optimizing modulo operations (still working on it after the merge)](https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/30653)<br/>
[Optimizing list creation](https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/31816) co-authored with [**godlygeek**](https://github.com/godlygeek)<br/>
